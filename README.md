Abstract: Security is regarded as a key concern of home
automation systems since it ensures the resident's comfort
and well-being. As crime is piling up rapidly in todayâ€™s
culture, home defense devices are very important. With the
advent of innovative technology in recent years,
homeowners can go outside the home with relief as modern
home security systems offer ample protection against
burglars, fire, smoke, etc. This article implements a smart
protection box for legitimate personnel that can help to
notify when an unapproved user tries to infringe the
security of necessary materials inside the box for taking
immediate actions. Two other main aspects of this smart
security box, along with the upgraded security features are
affordability and accessibility. This low-priced, low-power
enabled the smart security box based on empirical research,
is found to be durable and reliable in detecting and
providing legal customers with security violation
notifications. This forthcoming smart security box can
detect security breaches with the highest accuracy of 100%
if proper light facilities can be arranged along with the
warning SMS transmission within 800 milliseconds. This
low-cost device has been built for only 62.5$ and can be
commercially exploited for smart security technologies in
the local and foreign markets.
